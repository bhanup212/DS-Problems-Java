2. find longest sub array
3. find max sub array sum
4. find smallest sum in contiguous sub array
5. find length of sub array containing at-least one duplicate 
6. find array is Palindrome or not
7. find array Bitonic or not
8. find array sorted or not using recursive callback
9. find array is sorted or not without recursive callback
10. find average of array by using recursive callback
11. find the closest pair from two sorted arrays

Problems on LinkedList
1. print all nodes
2. get size of linked list
3. insert new node at specified node
4. insert new node at head or end 
5. get last node
6. delete node by using key or by position
7. find second last node
8. move last node to first i.e as head
9. find middle element/node 
10. find middle element by recursive callback
11. reverse the linked list
12. reverse linked list using recursive callback
13. print linked list in reverse
